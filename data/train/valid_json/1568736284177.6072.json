End to End project management & execution - front end business experience,\ndealing with clients and understanding their needs as well as hands on in\ndata extraction and statistical model development and validation \n\na. CVM Team: Developed a Logistic regression model to identify potential\ncustomers who has propensity to churn. The model has reduced the churn\nrate by 1.5% o Developed a Logistic regression model to identify\npotential customers who can migrate to another plan. Scoring of the\nmodel has helped the marketers in targeting right set of customer and\nincreased campaign performance.\n\nb. Fraud Analytics - Based on customer behavior and tenure, identified\nvarious customer segments for never pay fraud, developed statistical\nmodel for each identified segment, which resulted in more than \u20ac 270K\nbenefit\n\nc. Cohort Analysis: Developed a dashboard which identifies the customer\nmovement from segment to segment (High to Low Value), explaining reason\nbehind the movement. which has helped marketing team in quick decision\nmaking and campaign designing o Inactivity Analysis: Identified the\ntriggers for structural inactivity. Helped the business in preventing\ncustomer from becoming inactive and came up with suggestion to make\ncustomer active again.
